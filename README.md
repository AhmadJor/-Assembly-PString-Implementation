This repository showcases my ability to write code in low-level assembly language. It contains a complete implementation of a PString structure, written entirely from scratch in assembly language.

The implementation consists of multiple files, each of which contributes to the overall functionality of the PString structure. The files include assembly source code, header files, and examples demonstrating the use of the PString structure.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in writing low-level assembly code, as well as my ability to design and implement complex data structures in a low-level language. The PString structure provides a good example of how to implement a string data type in assembly, and demonstrates the trade-offs and challenges associated with writing code in this low-level language.

Whether you are a student, researcher, or practitioner in the field of low-level programming, this repository is sure to provide valuable insights into the design and implementation of data structures in assembly. The code and documentation included in this repository provide a solid foundation for further exploration and experimentation in this area.
